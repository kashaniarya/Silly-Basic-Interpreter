Brief Summary:
The Silly Basic Interpreter reads in an SBIR program (a fake program made by the professor) 
from the file whose name is specified in the argument list, stores it in a list, 
and then interprets that inter- mediate representation. During interpretation, 
numbers are read from the standard input and results written to the standard output.
